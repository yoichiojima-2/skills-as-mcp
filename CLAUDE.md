# Development Guidelines

## Commit Messages
- Never include "generated by AI", "Co-Authored-By: Claude", or similar AI attribution
- Keep messages concise and descriptive

## Code Style
- Line length: 120 characters
- Use `uv run ruff check --fix src/` and `uv run ruff format src/` before committing
- Python 3.13+ features are encouraged (type unions `|`, match statements)

## Testing
- Always write tests for new functionality
- Run tests with `uv run pytest`
- Test files go in `tests/` directory

## Workflow
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

## Package Management
- Use `uv` for dependency management
- Run `uv sync --dev` to install dependencies
- Add new dependencies to `pyproject.toml`

```
